## About Me

Officially, I am an MSc student and research engineer working on distributed systems and edge computing.  
Unofficially, I enjoy explaining complex ideas with football metaphors and arguing about system design.

This website is intentionally simple. If you are still reading, we will probably get along.

## Contact

You can reach me by email for research, collaboration, or conversations that start casual and end technical.
